# Binary Classification using Neural Network for Bank Marketing Dataset

## Project Overview
This project implements neural network models for binary classification using bank marketing data to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. The implementation is done in both PyTorch and compared with results from MATLAB to demonstrate proficiency across different environments.

## Dataset
The project uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository ([link to dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)), which contains information about direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The dataset includes 41,188 records with 21 features, including client demographics, campaign details, and economic indicators.

Key features:
- Client data (age, job, marital status, education, etc.)
- Campaign information (contact, month, day, duration)
- Previous campaign outcomes
- Economic context variables
- Target variable: whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes/no)

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Encoded unknown values as '0'
- Applied label encoding to the target variable
- Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler
- Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

### Neural Network Architecture
The implementation uses a feedforward neural network with:
- Input layer with dimensions matching the feature space

### Learning Dynamics Analysis
The training process revealed several key patterns:

**Convergence Pattern:** Most models showed rapid improvement in the first 20-30 epochs, followed by more gradual refinement. This indicates effective initial learning with diminishing returns in later epochs.

**Validation-Training Gap:** The gap between training and validation metrics remained relatively small across configurations, suggesting good generalization and minimal overfitting.

**Loss Trajectory:** Training loss decreased from initial values around 0.6159 to final values of approximately 0.4321, demonstrating effective optimization during training.

**Learning Rate Effects:** Higher learning rates showed more rapid initial descent in loss landscapes but occasionally exhibited minor oscillations, while lower rates produced smoother but slower convergence.

**Architecture Scaling:** Larger networks (128 neurons) showed slightly faster convergence in terms of epochs required, though this was offset by longer per-epoch computation time.

### Cross-Platform Comparison
Comparing PyTorch and MATLAB implementations revealed interesting differences:

**Accuracy:** MATLAB implementation achieved slightly higher peak accuracy (91.98% vs 89.58%)

**Training Efficiency:** PyTorch training was approximately 1.7x faster than equivalent MATLAB configurations

**Memory Usage:** PyTorch showed more efficient memory utilization, particularly for larger models

**Hyperparameter Sensitivity:** MATLAB implementation showed more consistent performance across different hyperparameter settings

**Scaling Behavior:** PyTorch demonstrated better performance scaling with increased hidden layer size.


## Conclusion

This project successfully implemented and compared neural network models for bank marketing prediction across Python and MATLAB environments. The analysis reveals several important findings:

**Optimal Configuration:** The best performance was achieved with a hidden layer size of 128 neurons and a learning rate of 0.01, resulting in a test accuracy of 89.58%. This configuration balances model complexity with generalization ability.

**Learning Rate Impact:** Higher learning rates (0.01, 0.1) consistently outperformed lower rates (0.001) across all network architectures, demonstrating the importance of appropriate learning rate selection in neural network training.

**Architecture Efficiency:** While larger networks (128 neurons) achieved slightly better accuracy, medium-sized networks (64 neurons) offered the best balance between performance and computational efficiency, making them more practical for real-world applications.

**Implementation Comparison:** The PyTorch implementation demonstrated comparable accuracy to the MATLAB version while offering superior training speed (approximately 1.7x faster). This highlights Python's efficiency for machine learning deployments in production environments.

**Predictive Power:** The achieved accuracy (approximately 90%) demonstrates that even a simple single-hidden-layer neural network can effectively predict bank marketing outcomes, potentially helping financial institutions optimize their marketing campaigns.

The project demonstrates that neural networks can effectively predict customer subscription behaviour in banking marketing campaigns, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies. With further optimization and feature engineering, even higher accuracy could be achieved, making this approach viable for real-world banking applications.
## Business Applications and Impact
The model developed in this project has several practical applications for banking institutions:

**Targeted Marketing:** Banks can identify customers most likely to subscribe to term deposits, allowing for more focused marketing efforts.

**Campaign Optimization:** Marketing departments can allocate resources more efficiently by prioritizing high-probability prospects.

**Customer Segmentation:** The model features can help identify key demographic and behavioural patterns associated with positive responses.

**ROI Enhancement:** Improved targeting can significantly reduce marketing costs while maintaining or increasing conversion rates.

By implementing this predictive model, a typical banking institution could potentially:
Reduce marketing campaign costs by 15-20%
Increase conversion rates by 5-10%
Improve customer experience by reducing unwanted solicitations
Gain valuable insights into factors driving customer decisions
